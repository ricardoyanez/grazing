grazing (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * C05ADF: Removed calls to ZBACK and ZBRAC. Caused changes to original A and B, leading to errors in calling function.
  * D01ASF: Bug, IORD and NNLOG not dimensioned causing segmentation fault in QUADPACK dqpsrt.
  * QUADPACK Makefile download dqagie.f, dqelg.f, dqk15i.f, dqpsrt.f twice. Fixed.
  * Removed patches to zbrac.f and zbrack.f.

  * Initial release.
  * Created github repository https://github.com/ricardoyanez/grazing
  * Downloaded GRAZING_9 from http://personalpages.to.infn.it/~nanni/grazing/

  * C05ADF replaced with Numerical Recipes ZBRENT
  * D02BBF substituted with RKSUITE.
  * S15ADF substituted with erfc().
  * S14ABF substituted with lgamma().
  * D01AMF substituted with DQAGI from QUADPACK. -fno-automatic added to FFLAGS.
  * S18DEF substituted with Amos Bessel routine ZBESI.
  * D01ASF substituted with DQAWFE from QUADPACK.
  * E01BEF substituted with DPCHIM from PCHIM.
  * E01BFF substituted with DPCHFE from PCHIM.
  * D01GAF substituted with FOURPT, a port from ALGOL of the Gill-Miller Algorithm.
  * E01BGF substituted with DPCHFD from PCHIM.
